# Counter App

**eCommerce type shopping cart**

## Motivation

A learning exercise in React and the functionality of components and state

## How to use?

Simply label each counter and use its 'Increment' button to add intervals of one to itself. 'Delete' will remove the counter all together and 'Reset' will zero each counter that remains. The counter adjacent to the Navbar is counting how many counters have a value greater than zero.
